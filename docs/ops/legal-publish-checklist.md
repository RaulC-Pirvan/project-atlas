# Legal Publish Checklist

Use this checklist before moving legal policy pages from draft to production.

## Blocking fields (must be finalized)

- Legal entity name
- Registered address
- Court venue city
- VAT/company registration number

## Release checks

- Replace all `TBD` legal placeholders in `/legal/privacy`, `/legal/terms`, and `/legal/changes`.
- Confirm `Version`, `Effective date`, and `Last updated` are set for each legal page.
- Add a dated entry in `/legal/changes` summarizing the release.
- Confirm public access for `/legal/privacy`, `/legal/terms`, `/legal/refunds`, and `/legal/changes`.
